    <p>
      Hello everyone! This is the landing page that will contain the navigation
      to all of my future html/javascript/CSS experimentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this webpage/webpage link would contain the class/coursework that I do
      in Bachelor of Design (Digital Media), Interactive Media. To see course
      related work click on the Interactive Media Button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this webpage is a
      <b style="color: #dc143c"><i>work in progress.</i></b> And presumbly will
      look better. When I dabble more in web development.
      <!--Also god damn it colour in this html coding website is spelt the American way. I am slightly salty about this.-->
