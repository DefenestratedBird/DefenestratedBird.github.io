          <h2>Brooomsticks.com: A Closer Look</h2>
          <h3>Q&A with Lanchu Zheng</h3>
          <div>
            <b>Q1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>“The man whose work we don't notice.” title on the splash page. Because it is the largest text on the web page and takes up about ⅓ of the web page space. And also because it’s aligned centred in the web page. </p>
            <b >Q2. In your two minutes spend with the website tell me about your discrete actions?</b>
            <p>
              <b>A. </b> My discrete actions are these in this order:
              <ol>
                <li>Click on the "Profession" tab.</li>
                <li>Scroll downwards.</li>
                <li>Click on the “Clean where there is no littering” bin graphic.</li>
                <li>And then the “Click to send rays of kindness to all people in the working professions.”</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <b>Q3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>The “Click to send rays of kindness to all people in the working professions.” Because it's fun to click on.<p>
          </div>
          </p>

          <p>My only criticism from a UX perspective is that this heart button is very easy to miss, considering how in the previous section 3 hands were holding out 3 hearts. But it does its job to tell the story of under-appreciated janitors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox3">
          <div class ="Bb3TextBelowImg">
            <p><b>A. </b>Scrolling, lots of scrolling. Considering that this whole website aims to tell a story. And most stories that use webpages as a medium to tell their narratives tend to have a lot of scrolling downwards or sidewise.</p>
            <b>Q5. What was your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>Firstly, the website does a good job of its purpose:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox4">
            <p>
              <p> "To show the importance & value of professions, so that ‘working’ professions are not treated with prejudice, but on the contrary appreciate the labour of others.” And especially janitors."</p>
              <p>Secondly it gives a good background historical context & highlights the impact of janitors if they were to disappear. Personally speaking I would have liked a more factual-based approach to saying: “All working professions are important.</p>
              <b> Q6. How did the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</b>
              <p><b>A. </b>The interactive experience communicated its primary goals through the following elements are common through many <a class="def" href="https://shorthand.com/the-craft/scrollytelling-examples/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScrollytelling%E2%80%9D%20(scroll%20%2B%20storytelling,audio%2C%20video%2C%20and%20animation." target="_blank">Scrollystories:</a>
              </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Horizontal scroll animations, that trigger images to move from either left to right or right to left when the user scrolls downwards.</li>
            <li>Parallax Scrolling Effects</li>
            <li>Animations that are either triggered initially when the user scrolls or as the user scrolls.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox5">
          <img src="/assignments/a1/images/Interactive Media-Image2b.jpg" alt="Glitched Image"/>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox6">
          <p>
            <b>Q7. What was your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (How long? & How many different times?)</b>
            <p><B>A. </B>The webpage only supports one visit from the user, especially apparent with the no return to top function at the bottom of the webpage. And it is also the fact that the website is in the format of a Scrollystory.</p>
            <b>Q8. How did the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</b>
            <P><b>A. </b>As said before, this website discourages repeated user interaction, it’s a one-and-done scrollystory that achieves its purpose of advocating the “importance & value of professions.”</P>
            <p>I would suggest that the creator provides links to further resources to learn more about the website’s subject matter if she wants to promote further user interaction with the website.</p>
            <b>Q9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does this website reference? </b>
            <p><b>A. </b>This website reminds me of those teenage girl magazines, not in terms of visual style but more in terms of the visual complexities of different elements.</p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox7">
          <p> For example, both teenagers and this website have a lot of different images, shapes and patterns vying for the viewer’s attention.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Q10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</b>
            <P><b>A. </b>The fact that it looks sort of like a (teenage) magazine means that you should take your time to scroll and look over each element on the webpage, particularly the text.</P>
          </p>

          <P>
            <b>Q11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>The fact that this website looks like a magazine builds trust & comfort because of the following reasons:</p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Magazines themselves have been around since 1663. So this website builds trust & comfort because they have been around for so long.</li>
                <li>Is very visually appealing because of the colours that Christina chose to use. Both the magazine form & the colours makes the user to “browse” through the webpage.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </P>
        </div>
        <div class="bodybox8">
          <p>
            <b>Q12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>The “Click to send rays of kindness to all people in the working professions.” heart button. This is less of an issue stemming from the developer’s side, and more of a software issue. See the image on the left.</p>
            <p>Even though this website is a one-time experience. I would have liked a “Return to Top” function and the bottom of the webpage. So that I don’t have to manually scroll to the top again.</p>
            <b>Q13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</b>
            <p><b>A. </b>The different animation that triggers when the user scrolls, particularly the trash falling on the Taj Mahal. This part was good because it got the point of “the overall attractiveness of these cities will decrease” without janitors across quite simply.</p>
